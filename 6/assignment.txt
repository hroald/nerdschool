Pair programming

Basic concept: two people sit together and collaborate on code

TodayÂ´s task: 
- run through the FizzBuzz kata with test driven development and pair
  programming


First session, 20 minutes:
- Pomodoro style pairing: driver (writes the code) and observer (helps, reviews
  and remembers things you need to do later on). We'll rotate every 4 minutes.
  The driver goes to the pc to the right to become the observer there, while the
  observer becomes the driver where the coder is sitting.  


Second session, 20 minutes: 
- Test/method-paring: one person writes the test, the other writes the
  implementation code. Both should discuss. Rotate every 4 minutes.

Third session: 20 minutes: 
- Pomodoro style pairing but on a projector. There will be only one pair coding,
  but everyone can take their turn on screen. Everyone will contribute to the
  code. 


Last session:
- code review
